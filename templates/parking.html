    <p>Hello Hacker!</p>

    <p>
      Thank you all for registering for eHacks 2023. We are excited to meet
      everyone! A couple of quick notes regarding the event:
    </p>

    <h1>Discord</h1>
    <p>
      If you have not joined our Discord server, please do so here:
      {{discord_link}}. We will be using Discord as our main form of
      communication and will be releasing any important announcements regarding
      the event through Discord. It's also a space that you can use to
      communicate with other hackers.
    </p>

    <h1>Parking</h1>
    <p>
      Parking is very scarce around the venue. The parking lot around the venue
      is unfortunately not available to students. Street parking is an option,
      but it is not free the entire weekend and also not recommended. There are
      some parking lots around the venue (<a

        >Link to Google Maps Parking Info</a
      >), but their price fluctuates based on the events going on in the city.
    </p>

    <h3>If you are an SIUE Student...</h3>
    <p>
      we <b>really</b> recommend taking the bus. If you had marked that you were
      planning on providing your own transportation, you can have that changed
      by replying to this email indicating that you would like to take the bus
      <strong>by February 24th</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parking in the SIUE red lots is free over the weekend. We will send out
      more information regarding specific bus details in the coming days.
    </p>

    <h3>If you aren't an SIUE Student...</h3>
    <p>
      we <b>really</b> recommend carpooling if possible. Unfortunately, we do not have
      much control over the parking situation. If you are attending from St.
      Louis, the T-Rex Innovation Center is a few blocks away from a couple of
      MetroLink Stations (8th & Pine and Convention Center).
    </p>

    <p>
      The MetroBus also has a couple of routes that go near T-Rex. Here is a
      link to a map of the city's Metro routes:

        >Link to St. Louis Metro System Map</a
      >. T-Rex is located on Washington Ave, in between N 9th St and N 10th St
      and next to "The Dome at America's Center" (<a
