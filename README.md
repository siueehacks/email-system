# email-system

This is a program to help automate the process of sending confirmation eHacks emails.

Currently it reads from a csv, but I want to make it so it can connect directly to a google sheet.

## Instructions to Run

At the moment, this repository consists of two different scripts. I plan to make this the starting point for a Registration API.

To set up for both of the scripts, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running script.py

For script.py to work, you most add a .env file, or environment variables with these names and values:

```bash
SENDER_EMAIL=<Your Full Email>
PASSWORD=<App Password Generated by Google>
TEST_EMAIL=<Email to be BCC\'ed in all emails>
DISCORD_LINK=<Link to Discord that wil appear in email>
```

App Passwords can be viewed a generated here: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

### Running tshirts.py

For tshirts.py to work, you must add a .env file or environment variables with these names and values:

```bash
SHEET_ID=<The ID of the Google Sheet You Want To Manage>
```

To use the Google Sheets API, you will have to go into the Google Console and configure your project to use the sheets by following the instructions here: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python 

You will also need to manually change which column you will want to retrieve data from in the code.
